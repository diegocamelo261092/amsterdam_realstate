# amtersdam_realstate

 This project intends to capture data from Pararius, a realstate marketplace platform for the Netherlands. 
 Once the data is scrapped the data is processed to be written into a database, or a raspberry pi. 
 Once the data is stored another script is meant to extract that data, create insights and deliver those to the email.
